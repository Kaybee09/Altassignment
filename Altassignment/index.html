            <p>
                My name is kb, and I have always been driven by a deep curiosity for how things work, especially in
                the realm of technology.
                Growing up, I was the type of person who loved taking apart gadgets, whether it was an old mobile phone,
                a radio, or even a computer.
                My fascination with the inner workings of machines led me to pursue a formal education in computer science.
                I earned a degree in Business management from Lithuania and a degree in computer science, where I gained more solid foundation on how business work and 
                the important of innovation and technnology.
            </p>
            <p>
                During my time at university, I worked on several projects that honed my skills in various areas of
                engineering.
                Whether it was developing apps, automating processes, or collaborating with teams on hardware-software
                integration projects,
                I quickly realized that my passion for technology extended beyond just theory—it was the ability to use
                this knowledge to solve real-world problems that truly inspired me.
                After graduation, I worked with my previous company, where I contributed to CRM software project
                deepening my expertise in areas like project management, product design and collaborative problem-solving.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I am not immersed in the world of code and circuits, I enjoy playing video games, wating movies, and playing
                working out.
                These activities enhance problem-solving skills, boost creativity, improve focus and productivity,
                encourage collaboration and relaxation and stress relief

            <p><strong>Goals for the School of Engineering Program</strong></p>
            <p>
                My primary goal for joining the School of Engineering Program at AltSchool is to deepen my technical
                expertise and become proficient in advanced software engineering methodologies.
                I want to build on my existing knowledge, but I am particularly excited about exploring new areas, such
                as artificial intelligence, blockchain technology, and cloud infrastructure.
                These technologies are shaping the future, and I aim to be at the forefront of their development and
                implementation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another goal is to work on large-scale projects that have real-world applications,
                which is something I believe the program will offer. By working on these projects,
                I hope to enhance my problem-solving skills, gain experience in managing complex engineering processes,
                and learn how to deliver scalable and efficient solutions in a collaborative environment.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am also looking to expand my professional network through the program, connecting with both my peers
                and mentors.
                Building these relationships will not only help me learn from others but also open doors to future
                career opportunities.
                I aspire to one day contribute to impactful projects in areas such as fintech, healthcare technology, or
                even education,
                and I believe that AltSchool will provide me with the tools and connections to make that dream a
                reality.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, my personal mission is to use technology to improve lives,
                whether by increasing efficiency in systems or by developing solutions that address critical societal
                challenges.
                The School of Engineering Program at AltSchool offers a platform where I can align my technical pursuits
                with my desire to make a difference,
                empowering me to grow both personally and professionally.
